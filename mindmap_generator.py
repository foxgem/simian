        Based on the given article:
        1. try to summary and extra the key points for the diagram generation.
        2. these key points must be informative and concise. 
        3. these key points should highlight the author's viewpoints.
        4. try to keep the key points in a logical order.
        5. don't include any extra explanation and irrelevant information.
        
        Use them to generate a Mindmap. The syntax of mermain mindmap:
        <Basic Structure>
        mindmap
          Root
            A
              B
              C
        
        Each node in the mindmap can be different shapes:
        <Square>
        id[I am a square]
        <Rounded square>
        id(I am a rounded square)
        <Circle>
        id((I am a circle))
        <Bang>
        id))I am a bang((
        <Cloud>
        id)I am a cloud(
        <Hexagon>
        id{{I am a hexagon}}
        <Default>
        I am the default shape

        Icons can be used in the mindmap with syntax: "::icon()"

        Markdown string can be used like the following:
        <Markdown string>
        mindmap
            id1["`**Root** with
        a second line
        Unicode works too: ðŸ¤“`"]
              id2["`The dog in **the** hog... a *very long text* that wraps to a new line`"]
              id3[Regular labels still works]

        Here is a mindmap example:
        <example mindmap>
        mindmap
          root((mindmap))
            Origins
              Long history
              ::icon(fa fa-book)

        The max deepth of the generated mindmap should be 4.

        Try to avoid errors in the generated mindmap. Here is a list of common errors:
        - root((Tree-of-Code(ToC))), the correct format is root((Tree-of-Code))
        """
    ),
